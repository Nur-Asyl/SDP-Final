# Final Project
## Mage and Warrior
This project demonstrates the implementation of various design patterns in a game context. It features a warrior and a mage class, each with their unique set of attacks and spells. The project employs the following design patterns:

### Strategy: 
The strategy pattern is used to define different attack and spell behaviors for the warrior and mage classes.

### Adapter: 
The adapter pattern is used to convert the cast method of the mage class to the attack method of the main AttackStrategy interface.

### Observer: 
The observer pattern is used to notify the warrior class whenever the HP shrine increases their health.

### Decorator: 
The decorator pattern is used to apply buffs to the warrior and mage classes, enhancing their abilities.

### Singleton: 
The singleton pattern is used to ensure there is only one instance of each class (warrior, mage, and HP shrine).

### Factory: 
The factory pattern is used to create different types of attacks for the warrior class.
